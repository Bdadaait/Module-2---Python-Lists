# Task 1: Given the list of grades:

grades = [85, 90, 78, 88, 76, 95, 89, 80, 72, 93]
grades.sort()
print(grades)

# Task 2: Calculate the average grade and print it:

grades = [85, 90, 78, 88, 76, 95, 89, 80, 72, 93]

average = sum(grades)/ len(grades)

print (f"the average grade is : {average}")
